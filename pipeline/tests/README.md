Renders the built `index.html` (and, for `header-parity`, `catalogue.html`) in jsdom.
The geometry checks seed `localStorage` to skip the first-run frame, so they measure
the full map — the demanding case. `guide` is the one that exercises the first frame at several window sizes and measures the
result. A non-zero exit means do not promote.

Every check here is a mistake that shipped once:

| check | what it measures | the bug it catches |
|---|---|---|
| `default-view` | all 26 markers and 47 concerns drawn, annual panel only | rows silently rolled up on the first screen |
| `rows-and-panels` | one Annual chip, a subset panel names its overlap, edge weights equal, rows clickable | Basic Metabolic Panel rendering an empty group |
| `picker-shortcuts` | annual-only / select-all, and what they do to the rail | a shortcut that dims but does not act |
| `clear-of-the-panel` | widest label's right edge vs the 16px detail-panel gutter, 6 sizes | names sliding under the panel |
| `clear-of-the-rail` | leftmost label vs the rail edge, 5 sizes | names sliding under the rail |
| `equal-thirds` | three equal columns, two equal gaps, titles on one baseline | columns drifting out of proportion |
| `even-spacing` | gap spread within each column ≤ 0.6px | leftover height shared in proportion, not equally |
| `row-padding` | box-top to first baseline, last baseline to box-bottom | padding that grows with the window |
| `no-overlapping-highlights` | highlight boxes never overlap, all 13 panels on | a row pitch shorter than its own highlight |
| `scrolling-canvas` | canvas grows past the window, 68 markers drawn | content hidden instead of scrolled |
| `column-band` | titles live in the fixed band, no inline font sizes in the SVG | headings scrolling away |
| `header-parity` | one 56px header on all four screens; identical `id \| nav \| act` grid shape and nav labels; current marked; every bound id intact; in-place route switch | headers drifting apart, nav pills landing at a different x per screen, or a rebuilt header orphaning the JS that binds to it |
| `guide` | overlay is `position:fixed` and reserves no canvas height; scrim and ring take no pointer events; ring matches the rail's box and the two map columns to the pixel; one task at 16px; steps tick on the real action; retires for good and is remembered | a tutorial that blocks clicks, drifts out of register with the columns it points at, reserves layout, or comes back after being finished |
| `title-band` | band opaque and above the canvas, three titles in it, legend fully removed, counts moved to the header | a background painted with an undefined variable; dead layout reserved for a deleted panel |

The window size is stubbed through `clientWidth` / `clientHeight`, so these are
geometry checks, not screenshots — they fail with a number, not a judgement.
